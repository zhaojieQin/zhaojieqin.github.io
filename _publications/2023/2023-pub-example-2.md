  This study investigates the effects of air compressibility on the aerodynamic performance of the IEA-15 MW offshore wind turbine. We analyze how compressibility influences the flow field and aerodynamic loads at the blade tips where high rotational speeds occur. The research provides important insights for the design and optimization of large-scale offshore wind turbines operating under high tip-speed conditions.
