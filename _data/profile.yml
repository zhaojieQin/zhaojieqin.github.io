  <p>
    I am a PhD candidate in wind energy at Uppsala University, supervised by Professor Stefan Ivanell. My research focuses on wind farm wake modeling using GPU-accelerated Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) solvers, with emphasis on atmospheric boundary layer effects.
  </p>

  <p>
  My current work involves developing and applying <a href="https://git.rz.tu-bs.de/irmb/VirtualFluids" target="_blank">VirtueFluids</a>, an open-source GPU-based LBM solver, for large-scale wind farm simulations, aiming to advance understanding of wake dynamics and atmospheric interactions in wind energy systems.
